# My portfolio

This repository contains the source code of my website hosted at *https://aarnoveitola.github.io/myportfolio*.

You can find the source code for the latest deployment of this project in the branch _portfoliov2_.

The website is a single-page application, hosted via _GitHub Pages_. The application is built using basic CSS, Bootstrap v4.0, as well as some custom JavaScript.

BEWARE! This version of the portfolio is still work-in-progress, so it may suffer from some inconsistensies regarding content.
