# My portfolio

This repository contains the source code of my website hosted at *https://aarnoveitola.github.io/myportfolio*. 

You can find the source code for the latest deployment of this project in the branch *portfoliov2*.

The website is a single-page application, hosted via *GitHub Pages*. The application is built using basic CSS, Bootstrap v4.0, as well as some custom JavaScript.

BEWARE! This version of the portfolio is still work-in-progress, so it may suffer from some inconsistensies regarding content.
