                  Two models were implemented and compared: Logistic Regression
                  and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). After data cleaning, feature
                  selection, and preprocessing (including handling missing
                  values and feature scaling), both models were evaluated using
                  a train/validation/test split. KNN achieved the best
                  validation performance and was selected as the final model,
                  reaching approximately 78% accuracy on unseen test data.

                  Beyond prediction accuracy, the project focuses on model
                  evaluation and interpretation, using metrics such as accuracy,
                  log loss, confusion matrices, and classification reports to
                  understand strengths and limitations—particularly the
                  challenge of class imbalance in survival outcomes. The project
                  demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, from data
                  preprocessing to model comparison and evaluation, using Python
                  and scikit-learn.

                  <i>focusEGG</i> is a product we worked with for a
                  User-centered Product Development Project course for Aalto
                  University. It is a modern pomodoro timer, which aims to aid
                  students experiencing difficulties with focus and short
                  attention span.

                  Due to information flood caused by digitalization and social
                  media, these symptoms are experienced by a significant portion
                  of university students. <i>focusEGG</i> tackles these issues
                  by providing a modern portable concentration timer, which
                  integrates directly with your smartphone and is very
                  accessible. The product consists of the timer itself and a
                  mobile application, which communicate via Bluetooth.

                <p class="text-block">
                  The product development was done with two User-Centered Design
                  cycles, consisting of user-research, design and prototyping,
                  and usability testing with real users. The prototype is built
                  using an <i>Arduino Nano</i> microcontroller, programmed with
                  <i>C++</i>.

                <p class="text-block">
                  This group project focused on understanding how senior
                  customers experience and use services at the Etelä-Haaga
                  Library. Through interviews with seniors and staff,
                  questionnaires, observations, and affinity diagramming, we
                  identified key user groups and mapped the end-to-end customer
                  journey. The study revealed strengths such as the library’s
                  welcoming atmosphere, strong community role, and helpful
                  staff, alongside recurring pain points including limited
                  availability of popular books, long reservation queues, early
                  closing hours, accessibility challenges, and difficulties with
                  digital payment and printing services. Based on these
                  insights, the project outlines service improvement
                  opportunities that emphasize accessibility, clarity, and
                  senior-friendly service design.

                </h3>
                <p class="text-block">
                  This group project focused on designing a mobile user
                  interface for manually reporting planted trees as part of the
                  BioAfrica project. The goal was to support environmental
                  monitoring by enabling accurate and consistent data collection
                  in the field. The UI concept includes a map-based interface
                  for visualizing planting locations, a streamlined form for
                  adding tree data, analytics for tracking impact over time, and
                  a profile view for personal records. The design was guided by
                  established usability heuristics and emphasizes clarity,
                  minimalism, and ease of use, supporting both individual
                  volunteers and organizations involved in tree planting and
                  environmental restoration.
